Unless you've been hiding under a rock for the past few years you've probably heard of this little piece of retro technology called VR, but VR is just for Games, right?

Let me introduce you to WebVR. Yes. VR on the Web, in your browser and it works right now. Its early days yet but specs are being written and things are being built with it - not only is it awesome to experience its super fun to build with and experiment new ideas with and has a very low barrier to entry. You need a decent smartphone with a browser, a cardboard VR headset and a little bit of Code and you're rolling.
