#JavaScript is Amazing and Nobody is Happy.

There's this popular LouisCK bit that he did a while ago now on Conan : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akiVi1sR2rM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akiVi1sR2rM)

Lets not focus on all the negativity currently surrounding JS and its eco-system. The name-calling, the witch hunts and the anti-[insert framework/library] bandwagon. Its anti-productive and whilst were sitting around throwing fuel on the fire, we're missing out. There are some amazing things you can do with JavaScript that you couldn't do 5 years ago. You can build native desktop apps or games, you can do the same for mobile phones. You can program robots, helicopters and lightbulbs. You can build a CLI to take an MP3 file, phone someone and play that file to them over the phone. If you were so inclined.

Everyone is talking about the things that make them feel sad about the current state of JavaScript tools, utilities, frameworks, but lets take these things that open the door to making amazing things and build something great. 

Key takeaway from this talk : "Its not the tools that matter, it's what you achieve with them that count."
